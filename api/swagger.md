# API documentations

## What's this for

API documentations using OpenAPI specification. Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and test REST APIs right into your service.

## Swagger.json

The APIs are defined here. This is read by the swagger-ui generator.

## Go-resource

The static files are stuffed into a single go file to include into the compiled image. Go-resource is a utility to stuff the resources into a golang source file.
